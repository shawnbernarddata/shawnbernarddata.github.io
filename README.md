# Data Science/Engineering Portfolio

Hello! I'm Shawn, a 25-year-old data enthusiast based in Brooklyn, NY. Despite my initial goals for medical school, introductory data science courses in college sparked a new passion within me. Diving into the world of data science, I pursued a Master's to refine my skills and knowledge. Now, I've begun an exciting career as a data scientist, eager to uncover insights that drive change. Beyond data, I enjoy spending time with loved ones, exploring new places, playing basketball, and hiking.

## Projects
### [Heart Disease Classification - KNN Demo](https://github.com/shawnbernard7/shawnbernard7.github.io/blob/main/projects/knn_heart_disease.ipynb)
In this exercise, I utilize K-Nearest Neighbors classification to classify heart disease presence. This is a demo where I perform KNN & cross-validation without using packages to show the inner-workings of these techniques.
### [Pubmed Metadata Extraction Demo](https://github.com/shawnbernarddata/shawnbernarddata.github.io/blob/main/projects/pubmed_etl.ipynb)
Here I extract basic metadata from Pubmed articles, pulling from a public domain & utilizing BeautifulSoup parsing in this notebook. This was a fun ETL exercise containing code which can be used as a backbone in other similar data extractions from the web.

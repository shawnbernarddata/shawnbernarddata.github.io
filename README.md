# Data Science/Engineering Portfolio

Hello! I'm Shawn, a 26-year-old data scientist based in Brooklyn, NY. I’ve worked across supply chain analytics and advertising, primarily in healthcare. Originally planning for medical school, I discovered a passion for data in college and went on to earn my Master’s in Data Science. Today, I focus on building models and uncovering insights that drive real impact. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new places, playing basketball, hiking, and spending time with friends and family.

## Projects
### [Heart Disease Classification - KNN Demo](https://github.com/shawnbernard7/shawnbernard7.github.io/blob/main/projects/knn_heart_disease.ipynb)
In this exercise, I utilize K-Nearest Neighbors classification to classify heart disease presence. This is a demo where I perform KNN & cross-validation without using packages to show the inner-workings of these techniques.
### [Pubmed Metadata Extraction Demo](https://github.com/shawnbernarddata/shawnbernarddata.github.io/blob/main/projects/pubmed_etl.ipynb)
Here I extract basic metadata from Pubmed articles, pulling from a public domain & utilizing BeautifulSoup parsing in this notebook. This was a fun ETL exercise containing code which can be used as a backbone in other similar data extractions from the web.
